# 🚀 SprintPlanner AI

### Clarity and Progress begin with a simple todo list.

**SprintPlanner AI** is the intelligent backend engine powering SprintPlanner — an AI-powered execution system for founders. It converts raw ideas into structured 4-week sprint plans using multi-agent orchestration, grounded in customer-first thinking, startup best practices, and real execution velocity.

## 🧠 Why SprintPlanner Exists

Most founders don't fail because of lack of ideas. They fail because of:

- No structured execution plan
- No validation framework
- No sprint accountability
- Overbuilding too early
- No clear metrics

**SprintPlanner fixes this.**

It helps founders move from:

> **Idea → Structured Plan → Weekly Execution → Measurable Progress**

---

## 🎯 Who It's For

- Early-stage founders
- Solo builders
- Indie hackers
- Venture studio teams
- Startup operators validating new products
- Technical builders who need GTM clarity
- Non-technical founders who need structured execution

---

## 🔥 Core Philosophy

SprintPlanner AI is built on principles from:

- Customer-first validation
- Minimum Viable Offer (MVO)
- Shadow testing
- Value-based selling
- Core business dynamics
- Parkinson's Law (time-constrained execution)

It is **not** a task manager. It is an **execution system.**

## ⚙️ What SprintPlanner AI Does

### 1️⃣ Converts Ideas into Structured Sprint Plans

**Input:**

```
"I want to build an AI tool for lawyers."
```

**Output:**

- ICP definition
- Problem framing
- Value proposition
- Validation plan
- 4-week sprint roadmap
- Weekly deliverables
- Metrics framework

### 2️⃣ Generates a 4-Week Execution Blueprint

Each sprint includes:

- Clear objectives
- Daily execution tasks

## 🏗️ System Architecture (High Level)

SprintPlanner AI is built using:

- **Python** (FastAPI / app.py)
- **Multi-agent orchestration engine**
- Structured output schemas
- Modular sprint generation logic
- Persistent sprint state tracking
- Containerised via **Docker**

**Architecture flow:**

```

## 📊 What Makes It Different

| Most tools | SprintPlanner AI |
|------------|-----------------|
| Help you manage tasks | Helps you **decide what to build** |
| Track work | **Validate before building** |
| Organize lists | **Focus on traction** |
| Flexible timelines | **Move in 7-day cycles** |
| Plan forever | **Ship faster** |

It's closer to a **startup co-founder** than a project tool.

## 🧩 Example Use Case

**Founder inputs:**

> "I want to build a micro-SaaS for restaurant inventory."

**SprintPlanner AI outputs:**

- **ICP:** 10–20 outlet independent restaurant chains
- **Core pain:** Inventory wastage & stock-outs
- **Validation strategy:** 10 interviews in 7 days
- **Offer:** Manual + spreadsheet-based MVP first
- **Sprint 1 goal:** Problem validation
- **Sprint 2 goal:** Paid pilot
- **Sprint 3 goal:** Automation layer
- **Sprint 4 goal:** First paying customers

---

## 📈 Execution Metrics Framework

Each sprint defines:

- Validation metric
- Revenue signal
- Engagement signal
- Retention signal
- Conversion trigger
- Next sprint criteria
